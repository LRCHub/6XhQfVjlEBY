```lrc
[00:29.43] You mince your words, but
[00:31.45] My sword speaks the truth
[00:33.29] Now, you must know that
[00:35.07] I am stronger than you
[00:38.25] You always slip and slide
[00:39.75] But you can't hide
[00:44.26] I challenge you to the death
[00:46.05] Let it be pistols at dawn
[00:49.70] That suits me fine
[00:51.72] Ain't no rush
[00:53.54] So don't hold your breath
[00:58.82] No heaven waits for you
[01:01.36] Only your demise
[01:05.69] It's time to face the truth
[01:08.83] And you realize
[01:19.80] Axe to the Grind
[01:24.29] Axe to the Grind
[01:29.12] I have an axe to grind with you
[01:32.04] I really hate you, through and through
[01:35.84] No matter what you do
[01:42.85] Well I've got you now
[01:45.16] Against the ropes
[01:46.98] I'm going in for the kill
[01:50.61] You are far beyond hope
[01:57.92] No heaven waits for you
[02:01.16] Only your demise
[02:04.70] It's time to face the truth
[02:08.60] And you realize
[02:18.74] Axe to the Grind
[02:23.83] Axe to the Grind
